                Modesto is a typeface that is based on signpainters lettering style that was popular in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The creator, Jim Parkinson, evolved this typeface from the Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey Circus Logo. He says that this typeface was not planned, rather, it just happened a few fonts at a time.
